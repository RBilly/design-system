# About UI-Kit

UI-Kit is a React component library that implements the Design System. \
The purpose of this project is to provide a unified toolkit used by UX-designers and developers. \
Using this library and following implementation guidelines, ensures projects will be accessible and ready to be internationalized. \
It also ensures a consistent and appealing look and feel that represent the brand and follows our design guidelines.

## Design principles

This project was created to help build products tailored to provide the best user experience possible for software interfaces running on skid platform. \
By providing unified, reusable and composable design elements, designing the layout of the projects of tomorrow will be simplified and accelerated.

## Development principles

This library is based on the [React Aria Component (RAC) library](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) which provides headless React components that helps build components for design system with a strong focus on [accessibility](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/accessibility.html), [internationalization](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/internationalization.html) and [interactions](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/interactions.html). \
It allows our team to focus on creating components with our unique design and styling rather than re-building these challenging aspects. \
React Aria is backed by AdobeÂ® and is meticulously tested which gives us the necessary confidence to build our component library on top of it.

By providing reusable and composable React component, development of new digital products based on React web applications will be greatly simplified and accelerated.
